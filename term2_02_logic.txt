Suppose their are 5 elements at index 0,1,2,3,4  
Index 0 to be swapped with index 1
Index 2 to be swapped with index 3
and Index 4 remains the same

Final index after running the code would be 1,0,3,2,4


For eg -
A list of element    : [ 10,20,30,40,50 ]
Initial Index        : [  0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

Output should be     : [ 20,10,40,30,50 ]
Final Index          : [  1, 0, 3, 2, 4 ]
